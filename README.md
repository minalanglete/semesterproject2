This is an e-commerce website that has customer-facing and admin sections. The page are populated by a Strapi API supplied by Noroff.

## Description

This is a webpage that sells shoes, more specific sneakers. The page or compony are named Flaming Sneakers. This is a school project given from Noroff. The API that I am using for this project are supplied by Noroff. At the site I shows feature products at the homepage and the API fetches the content so it is possible to click and se detail of each product. It is a log in page where the the admin can add, delete or files the content as they like.

## Built With

- I have used Sass for styling
- Strapi are used for the API

The admin panel will open at `http://localhost:1337/admin`.

If you get a warning about not being able to use port 1337, check that no other Strapi instances are running in another command line or terminal.

You must apply all that you have learned in your studies so far. The site must have a good user experience and UI design, following todayâ€™s trends and design patterns.

Build a frontend with home, product list, product detail and cart pages.
